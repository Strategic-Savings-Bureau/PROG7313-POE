## 🛠️ Part 2 Feedback Implementation

### **Feedback:**  
> *"Allow users to take a picture of a receipt."*  
>  
> *Score: 7/10 – Feature worked for uploads from gallery, but lacked direct camera integration.*

### **Solution:**

We enhanced the receipt feature with a **user-friendly dialog**:
- When attaching a receipt, users can now:
  - **Take a photo using the device camera** (real-time).
  - **Select an existing image** from their gallery.
- Both methods upload the image to **Supabase Storage** and instantly link it to the transaction.
- The image is viewable in transaction details, fully meeting the acceptance criteria and improving the user experience.

**Implementation Highlights:**
- Uses Android’s `ActivityResultContracts` for both camera and gallery.
- Receipt images are securely uploaded to cloud storage and linked in the local database.
- Seamless UI: The selection dialog appears wherever an image can be attached.

## 🚦 GitHub Actions & Workflow Automation

Modern app development demands reliability, consistency, and speed. For the Strategic Savings App, we leveraged **GitHub Actions** and workflow automation to ensure every code change is automatically built, tested, and validated before merging into the main codebase.

### Why GitHub Actions Matter for Our Project

- **Continuous Integration (CI):**
  - Every push and pull request triggers our CI workflow.
  - The app is built and tested automatically, catching bugs before they reach production.
  - Ensures code quality stays high, even as the team grows or changes.

- **Automated Testing:**
  - Unit tests and lint checks run headlessly on every new commit.
  - This prevents regressions and saves manual QA time.

- **Build Automation:**
  - Android builds are generated in clean, reproducible environments.
  - Ensures every team member and reviewer sees the same results.

- **Seamless Collaboration:**
  - Workflows create status checks and pass/fail badges on pull requests.
  - Developers get instant feedback, helping us move fast without breaking things.

### How We Utilize GitHub Actions

- **Workflow Location:**  
  All our workflows live under `.github/workflows/` in the repo.
- **CI Pipeline:**  
  - **Build:** Checks out code, sets up the correct JDK and Android SDK, and builds the APK.
  - **Test:** Runs all unit and instrumentation tests.
  - **Lint:** Ensures code style and best practices are followed.

**Result:**  
Thanks to GitHub Actions, every commit is automatically validated, builds remain reproducible, and our team can confidently ship high-quality code at speed—without ever worrying about "it works on my machine" problems.
